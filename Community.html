        <h2>One Great Example</h2>
        <p>Most of the phones like Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi have apps where they track your steps, calories, sleep and etc. As I use Samsung I will talk about it.</p>
        <p>There is a thing called Samsung Health Together which promotes daily steps. to win the badge and stars of the month you have to do 200K steps in a given time.</p>
        <p>There is a Leader-board which shows you rank amongst other participants in the same challenge.</p>
        <p>I think that this is something that could benefit the most as it motivates you to walk more, As walking is one of the best things you can do it is a great challenge.</p>
