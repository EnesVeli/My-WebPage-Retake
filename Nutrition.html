                    <p>Macronutrients are carbohydrates (carbs), fat, and protein. For healthy adults, the <cite><a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/health-and-medicine-division">Health and Medicine Division of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States</a></cite> recommends the following balance for your calories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>45-65% from carbohydrates</li>

                        <li>10-35% from protein</li>

                    <em class="FYI">This is the percentage of calories, not the percentage of each food type in your diet by weight. For example, you might need more grams of protein than grams of fat to get the same number of calories.</em>
