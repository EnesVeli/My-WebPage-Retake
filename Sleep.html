            <li>You regularly sleep a total of seven to nine hours in a 24-hour period.</li>
            <li>While in bed, your sleep is continuous you don't have long periods of lying awake when you wish to be sleeping.</li>
            <li>You wake up feeling refreshed, as if you've "filled the tank."</li>
            <li>You feel alert and are able to be fully productive throughout the day. You also don't fall asleep unintentionally, like while watching television.</li>

        <h2>Sleep and Phone Usage:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Phones can be psychologically stimulating. Seeing exciting, stressful, or enjoyable content can be keeping us awake at night.</li>
            <li>Phones are also physiologically stimulating. The light from phones suppresses the sleep hormone melatonin, which can make it more difficult to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>Try a digital curfew where you stop using phones 2 hours, 1 hour, or at least 15 min hour before bed.</li>
            <li>Keep all televisions, computers, and telephones out of the sleeping environment. Reserving the sleeping environment for sleep helps your mind and body connect being in your bedroom with being asleep.</li>
            <li>If you must use your phone at night, try a light filter option or dark mode to reduce the amount of blue light emitting from the phone.</li>
